## About

This is a project proposed by Alura and Oracle for the ONE (Oracle Next Education) program in which we are asked to build a page to encrypt text.  
So I present my version of the project in which I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements:

- It should work only with lowercase letters.  
- Letters with accents or special characters must not be used.  
- It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version as well as return an encrypted word to its original version.  
**For example:**  
  + "cat" => "gaitober"  
  + gaitober" => "cat"
- The page must have fields for insertion of the text that will be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.  
- The result should be displayed on the screen.

#### The encryption "keys" that we will use are the following:

> The letter "e" is converted to "enter"  
> The letter "i" is converted to "imes"  
> The letter "a" is converted to "ai"  
> The letter "o" is converted to "ober"  
> The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"
